Description: seqsetvis enables the visualization and analysis of multiple 
    genomic datasets. Although seqsetvis was designed for the comparison of 
    mulitple ChIP-seq datasets, this package is domain-agnostic and allows the 
    processing of multiple genomic coordinate files (bed-like files) and 
    signal files (bigwig files or bam pileups).
