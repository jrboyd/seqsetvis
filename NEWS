# seqsetvis 1.1.2

* bugfix: viewGrangesWinSample/Summary_dt were both erroring when 0 reads were in window.
* bugfix: ggplot2 2.3.0 compatibility fix in ssvSignalLinePlotAgg()
* bugfix: col2hex now properly preserves character vector names
* bugfix: ssvFetch now properly allows NA for fragLens to disable fragment extension
* bugfix: ggellipse line_scale and color_scale were being ignored

# seqsetvis 1.1.1

* bugfix: skip rtracklayer::import.bw depedent tests on Windows OS

# seqsetvis 1.1.0

* seqsetvis is released!

# seqsetvis 0.99.20

Impacts existing scripts

* fetchWindowedBam is now ssvFetchBam.single
* fetchWindowedBamList is now ssvFetchBam
* fetchWindowedBigwig is now ssvFetchBigwig.single
* fetchWindowedBigwigList is now ssvFetchBigwig
* fetchWindowedSignalList is now ssvFetchSignal

Independent addititions

* anchor parameter for all fetch functions.  allows strand sensitive x assignment
and left or center reference point.
* added viewGRangesWinSummary_dt() -  allows summary statistic to be appled over
windows in contrast to sampling method. allows qgr to be varying width.
* renamed viewGRangesWindowed_dt() to viewGRangesWinSample_dt()

# seqsetvis 0.99.18

* updated package title
* updated vignette title

# seqsetvis 0.99.17

* fetch functions, _dt versions removed and param return_data.table = FALSE
added
* refactoring to encapsulate fetch utility functions shared by bw and bam

# seqsetvis 0.99.13

* added bamFetch*
* refactored bwFetch* to use viewGRangesWindowed_dt, same as bamFetch*
* ssvSignalClustering and Heatmap bug fixes related to hardcoded data.table
variables
* restructured and renamed extdata to be cleaner/more intuitive.

# seqsetvis 0.99.12

* small changes to clear warning for Bioc acceptance.

# seqsetvis 0.99.10

* fewer and smaller vignette figures
* ggellipse exported with documentation
* ssvSignalHeatmap calcs better xticks
* ssvFeatureBinaryHeatmap true_color and false_color params added to allow
color control
* ssvFeatureVenn and Euler params unified
* ssvFeatureBars has bar_color param like that of venn and euler

# seqsetvis 0.99.9

* vigentte - some plots reduced in size and dpi reduced to save space.
* ssvFeatureVenn and Euler refactored to use common internal ggellipse function
for
consistency.
* ssvBinarizeHeatmap cleaned up plot output and changed default to
raster_approximation = FALSE

# seqsetvis 0.99.8

* fetch* now automatically calculate and apply a fixed width.
* BiocFileCache used for all URL resources in vignette
* vigentte uses cases for CTCF peak overlap and for chromHMM states complete

# seqsetvis 0.99.7

* fixed examples error for ssvSignalLineplot
* addressed BioC notes for seq_len instead of 1:x
* addressed BioC notes for vapply instead of sapply

# seqsetvis 0.99.5

* added easyLoad_narrowPeak() and easyLoad_broadPeak()
* added ssvFactorizeMembTable() for converting membership table to factor
* added movingAverage() from r cookbook
* rename ssvSignalTrackplot to ssvSignalLineplot
* rename bw_dt param to bw_data in all ssvSignal* functions to reflect increased
argument flexibility (GRanges or data.table accepted).
* expanded vignette to include more thorough overview, overview finished but need
use cases.

minor changes

* renamed vignette to seqsetvis_overview.Rmd

# seqsetvis 0.99.4

* rename overlapIntervalSets to ssvOverlapIntervalSets
* improved documentation for CTCF datasets used by vignette
* expanded vignette to include more thorough overview, work in progress.

minor changes

* added show_counts param to ssvFeatureBars

# seqsetvis 0.99.3

* all fetch functions that previously returned data.table now return GRanges by default
* all functions that accepted data.table now also accept GRanges and return the matching class where appropriate
* magrittr pipes removed from all package code and magrittr moved to suggests from imports
* misc minor changes to address reviewer comments (message instead of print, stopifnot to verify inputs, etc.)

# seqsetvis 0.99.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
