\usage{
ssvSignalLineplotAgg(bw_data, x_ = "x", y_ = "y", sample_ = "sample",
  color_ = sample_, group_ = sample_, agg_fun = mean, spline_n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bw_data}{a GRanges or data.table of bigwig signal.
As returned from \code{\link{ssvFetchBam}} and \code{\link{ssvFetchBigwig}}}

\item{x_}{variable name mapped to x aesthetic, x by default.}

\item{y_}{variable name mapped to y aesthetic, y by default.}

\item{sample_}{variable name, along with region_ used to group by default,}

\item{color_}{variable name mapped to color aesthetic, sample_ by default.
change group_ to override.}

\item{group_}{group aesthetic keeps lines of geom_path from mis-connecting.
Most useful if you need to supply a
variable to later facet upon. Defaults to value of sample_.}

\item{agg_fun}{the aggregation function to apply by sample_ and x_,
default is mean}

\item{spline_n}{if not NULL, applySpline will be called with n = spline_n.
default is NULL.}
}
\value{
ggplot of signal aggregated with agg_fun() by sample.
}
